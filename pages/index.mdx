### The rusty defense framework!

Welcome to the Catherine defense framework documentation! Our goal is to offer a quick and simple blue team framework for the following:

- Gathering information
- Data collection/manipulation
- Local and remote network analysis
- Reverse engineering solutions (hexadecimal dumping, reading, writing, and many other forms of data control)
- Port scanning
- Decoding/Decrypting strings and other types of data
- Web server hosting (custom HTML rendering)
- ExploitDB querying
- Underlying terminal commands within Catherine shell

Since Catherine is just entering a beta state, there's so much more to come before our first production release.

NOTE: Do not let the term "beta" deceive you, Catherine is in a usable and stable state for running the above operations!

*If you are running Catherine on macOS, Windows, Pi, or any other operating system other than debian based Linux systems (including WSL), please be aware that the behaviour may differ or issues could arise. While we have tested Catherine across multiple platforms, certain commands may not perform as expected.*

#### Creator Note
My name is [Hifumi1337](https://github.com/Hifumi1337), I am the creator of the Catherine framework. A little background about the framework and my decision to create it. When I originally started on the project, I wanted to create something oriented towards red team operations, but as time went on I noticed the community was already filled with red team solutions, so I pivoted. Why Rust? I love Rust. I am by no means an expert, but putting this together boosted my Rust experience and introduced me to a lot of different defense tools. I loved the challenge and hope to continue building out the modules. Thank you for checking out this tool. I hope it helps you. If you have any feature requests or issues, please feel free to submit them to the repository: [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Hifumi1337/catherine)
