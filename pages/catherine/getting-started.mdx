## Setting up Catherine
Setting up Catherine in your local environment is actually pretty simple. Since we are in a beta state, this process may change, but for now, you just have to download 1 file from GitHub releases, run the command below, and that's it!

This command will curl the installation script and execute it using the `bash` protocol. I recommend you review the code [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hifumi1337/catherine/main/Catherine_Installer). Never run a bash/shell script on your system without reviewing the code first (safety first!).

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hifumi1337/catherine/main/Catherine_Installer | bash
```

Once you've installed all of the modules, it's time to start Catherine! It shouldn't matter where the Catherine binary lives, but if you'd like to have it set in your PATH, you can set an `alias` or just move it to `/usr/bin/` or `/usr/local/bin`. As Catherine matures, I will include a better method for setting a PATH.
