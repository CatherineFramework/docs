# ðŸ¦€ Developing Modules ðŸ¦€

## Setting up Environment
Setting an environment for Catherine development is a pretty quick and simple setup.

Assuming you already have `cargo` installed, all you'll need to do is run `cargo check` or `cargo run` to verify the source is not throwing any errors. Once this is confirmed, you can start developing modules!

## Create a Module
Creating a module is a bit tedious right now, but should only take about < 2 minutes.

Step by step guide:

1. Open the `commands.rs` file located under `src/core/`
2. Use this line as a template (`const MODULE_PATH: &str = "modules/ModuleCat/ModuleName/dist/ExecName";`) to properly link your module. If unsure of how to format this, compare to the already established modules and try to follow the same format
3. Once the module has been linked, add the constant in the Command argument (check image below for example)

<br /><img src="../images/custom_module_example.png" style={{ borderRadius: "5px", boxShadow: "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) 0px 5px 15px" }} />

4. This step will require a bit of Rust knowledge, but don't worry, it's easy. Find the `Lion` module and just copy the match statement. Then change the path to your module. An example is posted below

<br /><img src="../images/custom_module_example_2.png" style={{ borderRadius: "5px", boxShadow: "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) 0px 5px 15px" }} />

5. You're now good to go!

NOTE: Please make sure your executable (built binary) is present in the directory specified or an error will be thrown.

How to test:

Run the `cargo run` command to start the Catherine shell
```bash
cargo run
```

Next set the module you'd like to test
```bash
ðŸ¦€ Catherine [v0.x.x]âš¡(None) ðŸŒ‘  ã€‰ set_module
ðŸ¦€ Catherine [v0.x.x]âš¡(set_module) ðŸŒ‘  ã€‰ YourModule
```

Now you should see the module output. If you run into any issues, feel free to reach out. The module process will most likely improve over time.

## Submitting a Pull Request
We are currently working on putting together a style guide and PULL_REQUEST.md document. For now, you can fork the repository or branch off and open a PR with in-depth information about your changes.
