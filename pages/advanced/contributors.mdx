## How to Contribute

We are currently working on putting together a style guide and PULL_REQUEST.md document. For now, you can fork the repository or branch off and open a PR with in-depth information about your changes.

## Style Guide

Working on it! ðŸ˜…

If you do submit a PR, please follow the basic style guidelines:

- Keep curly braces on the same line (semi-K&R)

- Always use semi-colons
- We try to only use tabs (2)
- No ambiguous variable/function names (must be 4+ characters, excluding module names)
- Use double-quotes (unless single-quotes are required)

We recommend using Prettier for these style guidelines. We are currently working on creating a `.prettierrc` file. Once this file is complete, it will be available in the repository.
