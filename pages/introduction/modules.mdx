Modules are the backbone of Catherine. While the framework offers many solutions directly within the core codebase, the provided modules expands Catherine's functionality beyond the bare minimum. Thanks to these modules, we are able to support almost any programming language we'd like. We currently have modules written in Python, Go, and C. Cool, right? While this process is not as streamline as other frameworks, we pride ourself on being versatile and open to everyone. If you have an idea for a module, you should check out our documentation here: [Create a Module](/advanced/development).
