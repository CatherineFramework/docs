## Style guide

A basic style guide has been constructed for pull requests:

- Keep curly braces inline (semi-K&R)
- Use semi-colons where possible
- Tab width = 2
- No ambiguous variable/function names (must be relevant to the responsibility of the function or variable)
- Use double quotes (unless single quotes are required)

I recommend using prettier for setting these style guidelines.
