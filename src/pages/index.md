## Quick start

Catherine can be easily installed by using the official Rust package manager, Cargo, but there is also an installation script for building from source. Below you'll find both ways of installing.

### Cargo

Installing via Cargo is quick and simple, but does require some extra configuration to access all available modules. First, you'll want to install the executable using Cargo:

```bash
cargo install catherine
```

{% callout title="Installing modules" %}
If you would like to install the modules, all you have to do is run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CatherineFramework/modules.git && \
mkdir /opt/catherine && \
mv modules /opt/catherine/
```

After you've cloned the repository, Catherine will immediately recognize the modules directory and pull the resources from it.
{% /callout %}

### GitHub releases

Installing from GitHub releases includes everything you'll need to get up and running. The provided script below will install the executable and modules for Linux.

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CatherineFramework/Catherine/install.sh > CatherineInstaller && \
chmod +x CatherineInstaller && \
./CatherineInstaller
```
