Catherine is a "pocket" framework built in Rust, created for simplicity and efficiency. The framework immediately gives the user access to numerous different information gathering and data collection options for almost any scenario. The framework offers port scanning, server hosting, exploit database querying, system control within the prompt, multiple custom modules for website and network analysis, and many more free options.

This is a free framework available to everyone. Contributions for new modules or core functionality will always be accepted.
